I am not a reader of non-fiction exactly, I have read a few of them in my life. Like many, ushered in via Chetan Bhagat's _Five point someone_.

Harry Potter has been on my mind since ages, but I always believed what is the point in reading a children's books, they are always about wild imagination, which does not hold the litmus test in the realms of life.

But then I inverted the stuff, by asking that if these books are filled with only wild-imagination, then why they have been so hugely successful, like some 450 million books sold in 79 languages, not all of them have been kids?

And sometimes, all we need in our life is the imagination to go wild, because from that's where some of the most original thoughts origin.

So, when my 8 years old nephew mentioned to me one fine day in December that he has bought, **Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone**; I knew that this the time to change my reading habit and let my horses also to run wild.

My original thought was to view and read the book through the eyes of an 8 year old kid, and then try to exchange the notes on the book with him. I would try to see what I missed to see. Also, the plan was not to share my notes with him, so as to bore him and try to seem more intelligent, because that would make the whole experiment go corrupt.

So both of us started reading the book and would exchange notes on the same, but as we know, kids are not excited on only one thing in their life at one point of time, there are myriad of things, and then I also got busy or rather appeared to be busy in the stupid things of life, which do not matter at all in the end.But for vanity's sake, I had to do them.

I started the book on _6th December 2016_ and finished it today on _23rd January 2017_. So for the year 2017, this is the first book which I have finished.

The book is brilliant to say the least.

While reading it, one is automatically transported to Hogwarts, for me it was so very much more apparent because it was a fiction book for me after ages.

Every book is about learning something new and initially I believed that the first book of Harry Potter would also have some moral lessons, since this was a kid; but to my surprise, it contains some of the biggest and most profound lessons of life, for everyone.

If we are able to grasp them, life would be a bliss...

**Here are some of my favourite ones:**

*_"However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible."_

*_"there is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it..."_

*_"After all, to the well-organised mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all - the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them."_

*_"'The truth.' Dumbledore sighed. 'It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.'"_

*_"You see, only one who wanted to _find_ the Stone - find it, but not use it - would be able to get it, otherwise they'd just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life."_

*_"'there are all kinds of courage,' said Dumbledore, smiling.'It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr.Neville Longbottom.'"_

Well, my favourite is the **third** and the **fifth** one. I have skipped the explanation as an exercise for yourself, but if you so wish my explanation or reasoning, you can always email me.

_I would like to exhort all the parents, whose kids have read this book, to read this book themselves also and then explain the finer points to their kids. They would not be able to understand that at once, but slowly over a period of time, if they manage to instil these thoughts in their heart, they would live a much happier and satisfied life._

As usual, Miss Rowling has saved the best for the last.

It was a thorough pleasure and revelation reading this book. Also, I am going to re-read this again, after a while.
