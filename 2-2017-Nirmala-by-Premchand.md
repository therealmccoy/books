This is my first reading of any Hindi literature since 1994, i.e. since I left my school. I am not sure why it took so much of time, but perhaps it was too schoolish to read any Hindi literature, after I left school, which inhibited to reach out my hand for a Hindi book.

I saw this book on Amazon at a discount, thought that since I have started the year already with a fiction book (please see 1 /2017), I might just continue the momentum and see what it happens.

But perhaps, deep down there was this guilt that I have not read any of the important literature of my own mother tongue and trying to find the truth in foreign language, in order to find the truth.

**Home is from where, once should begin.**

The hallmark of great authors and their book is that, what they have written is still valid after hundred of years, in the case of **Premchand**, for almost a hundred years.

Perhaps, they find the emotions to write upon, which would not be diluted by passage of time, the core of the human agony,ecstasy,pain,pleasure,triumph,disaster and focus on them only.

**Nirmala** is one such book, where it has been now more than 88 years, but still it feels that reading this book is still relevant. As if nothing has much changed, in the social fabric. Still the same people, their behaviour is till the same, perhaps only the metaphors have changed and it is ok, with passage of 88 years.

What is important is that, what author had been able to see from his own eyes some 90 odd years ago, I could see the very same thing, still happening, from my own eyes.

This is essentially the hallmark of great authors and books.

As I started reading the book, I wondered about the motive to write such a book and obviously the motive of like that of any other great book, would have been to give the readers some message, to make some wandering people reach home and make them able to see the truth.

I also wondered about the premise of the book, how he would have plotted the characters and the plot itself and from where he would have started?

After reading the book, it is clear to me that **Premchand** started with a clean slate and the basic premise about the message he want to convey in this book.

He picked one essential theme, one core message and probably that came from what he saw happening around him and needless to say it pained him so much that he decided to do something about it, and perhaps the most suited option was to reach out as many people as possible with his message, by writing a book.

**_The essential core message of the book is :_ Men marrying again, post their initial loss with a woman far younger than them, leads only to disaster.**

At first glance, it would seem like the person who has most endured and suffered is the lead protagonist, Nirmala. But this is not the matter of fact, if we introspect deep, we find that the person who suffered the most due to the lead event in the plot, the marriage, was the protagonist, **Lala Totaram**.

Well, how do we arrive at the conclusion, let us take the beginning, where basically the plot starts in the book, when Nirmala and Totaram get married. There is nothing which is going right for Nirmala, she was getting married against her wish, to a person already having three kids, who was also much elder to him, in a not so rich family.

For Totaram, everything was going well, except the fact that his wife had died. He had three loving kids, a good monthly income and he was going to get married to a young woman, again.

And in the end, though Nirmala dies, but it is Totaram who would have to endure every loss, including that of his three sons, as well as the woman whom he married, for some more time to come, alone, till he also dies.

Also, in between, though Nirmala suffered a lot, it has been so very evident that even Totaram was not exactly a happy man with the marriage, and suffered in equal measure, if not more.

**And all this suffering came to Totaram, because he married again, even after having one full grown kid, and two other kids, to a woman, who was less than half of his age.**

Hence we can confer that, essential message of **Premchand** in this book was about the malaise of older men, marrying much younger woman for their own lust and pleasure, essentially taking advantage of their plight and thus ruining, what could have been a beautiful life.

While focussing on the core message, he has also dwelled upon the other malaise which pained him and which surprisingly still plague the Indian society, if one has eyes to see.

Most notably dowry. How in the absence of a better option, a girl is married to any person, who would take lesser money as dowry, even for the fact that he is twice of her age, with three kids. A very well apt metaphor used by the author is of Nirmala's dream, where only a broken and hole-riddled boat is available for her to cross the river, and she is not allowed to ride on a fine boat. And ultimately, the hole riddled boat drowns.

**Premchand** also tries to exhort the women of his times to stand up against their husbands, if they feel that they are being taken for granted. But I am not sure that how successful that would have been, because in those times, girls and women of India were not allowed to learn and study.

With the sudden death of **Udaybhanu**, he is laughing at all those people, who are always hung in future, trying to build castle, when they are not even sure of what is going to happen at this very own moment.

**Even 88 years ago, the message was so loud and clear to live in present.**

Along with Dowry, author has subtly focussed upon the silly customs of those times, which are more or less still prevalent in these times, which make a marriage for aHindu family, more of a burden, rather than a celebration. Celebration is only for outsiders, who have nothing to do with it, for rest all, it is more of a burden, than anything else. And how do I know, that this is still true, it is for the fact that I attended two marriage sin my family last year and was able to follow, what happens.

There are at least one or two other messages about life, in every chapter, with which the author is trying to lead the readers to truth and they make reading this book, all the more worthwhile.
